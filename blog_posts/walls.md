#Walls

When you removed the pictures from the walls of the old man's house, you couldn't tell there was ever a picture there.  The walls were painted white but there were no finger prints from happy grandchildren, no yellowing from cigars smoked in celebration or cigarettes smoked in frustration.  It's a wonder a man could live to be 83 and have living room walls like this.  Maybe had he lived to 84, maybe even lived just one more week, he would have different walls completely.  Maybe not painted white and immaculate.  Maybe walls in a different house on a different street in a different city or even country.

Now the man who had been his caretaker for the past 12 years removed the paintings and photos from the walls.  He placed them in boxes along with kitchen utensils and the tools he utilized in his office, wrote in big letters with a thick tipped Sharpie on the brown cardboard.  He was disorganized; the old man would never mix all these different sorts of things into the same box.  He thought about all this while he placed masking tape over the drawers of his big oak desk as to keep them in place when the movers took them where ever the movers were going to take them.  The old man with perfect walls had no children and no kin living to take all his belongings so they were being donated.  He was a caretaker for someone else, but felt he could hardly take care of himself.  His indecision smacked him in the face; the old man's belongings had an undecided fate, though their former owner now had his.

When everything was boxed and what could be moved by a solitary man was placed in the garage, the caretaker, he lit a cigarette with a match he found in a kitchen drawer by the sink.  He ashed on the floor; he'd have to sweep and mop the place anyhow.  Then when he was done, he ran water over the pointed cherry, opened the window that gave view to the backyard, and flicked the cig into the grass.

What he did next was spit on the floor.  Couldn't tell you what brought that on.

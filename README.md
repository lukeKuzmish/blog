# Muh Blog in Ruby/Sinatra/Haml
This is an experiment to learn Ruby/Sinatra/Haml and because I feel like I need a blog.  It oughtta help my internet presence a bit.

I am "live" coding this.  You can see the results at [http://sinatra.lukekuzmish.com](http://sinatra.lukekuzmish.com).  As of 2:25 PM on 16 May 2014, it's not really working.  But away at it I will keep plugging!  Any comments or suggestions, hit me up at info@lukekuzmish.com

# Muh Blog in Ruby/Sinatra/Haml
This is an experiment to learn Ruby/Sinatra/Haml and because I feel like I need a blog.  It oughtta help my internet presence a bit, hyuck hyuck!

To run the app:
```bash
    ruby blogapp.rb
```

Views are written in Haml.  Blog posts are written in Markdown.  At the top of each post is a bit of YAML.  The format is

```
title:
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: item1, item2, item 3, item4, ...

blogpost here written in [MARKDOWN](http://http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

#lack of wit not ironic or intentional.
no memes.  ...maybe some memes, but no Good Girl Gina.
Some cat pictures.
```
